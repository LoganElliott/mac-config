# Terminal config for my Mac
I like having Solarized as my theme, vi as my terminal shell as well as displaying my current git branch and colouring all of this to make it super clear.

# Prerequisites
* Have sudo access
* To enable showing what vi mode you are on in the terminal you need to update your version of Bash, follow [this guide](https://github.com/Toberumono/Miscellaneous/wiki/Installing-Bash-4.3-on-Mac-OSX) to do that.

# Installation
1. Place .inputrc at ~/
2. Place .bash_profile at ~/
3. Place .vimrc at ~/
4. Download [Solarized](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized) and unzip
5. Import "Solarized Dark ansi.terminal" from osx-terminal.app-colors-solarized into your Terminal themes and select as default.
6. Increase font size to 16px
7. Restart terminal
